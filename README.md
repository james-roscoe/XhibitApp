**_Please note: As of February 2025, management of the live XhibitApp website was passed over to the [Xerte Project](http://www.xerte.org.uk). Therefore the code on this repository does not necessarily reflect the current live version of XhibitApp going forwards. Please contact the Xerte Project with any queries. Thank you._**

## What is XhibitApp?

XhibitApp is a supporting project for [Xerte](http://www.xerte.org.uk), the free, open source e-learning content creation tool.

This web app offers Xerte users the opportunity to produce a theme without having to learn HTML and CSS. The user's edits appear in real-time via a Xerte project preview window.

XhibitApp is accessible on desktop, tablet and smartphones.

The project was launched at the Xerte Conference on 14th April 2016 in Nottingham, UK.

## How do I get started?

It's easy - Visit the [XhibitApp website](http://www.xhibitapp.com/) to create your Xerte theme.

Feel free to browse or contribute to the source code on GitHub.

## For installing your own version of XhibitApp

To use XhibitApp, you can simply visit the [XhibitApp website](http://www.xhibitapp.com/).

However, if you wish to install XhibitApp on your own server (either locally or on the web), you may need to change the `config.php` file.

For localhost, e.g. via XAMPP, the default config file assumes that Xhibit is located in a directory named `/xhibitapp` in your document root (often 'htdocs'). You can then access it via localhost/xhibitapp. Please change the config file if your setup is different from this.

For the web, the default config file assumes that Xhibit is sitting at the top level of your site's home URL, e.g. http://www.xhibitapp.com. You can change the config file if this is not the case.
